description: >
  Competitive multi-model orchestrator that pits AI models against each other
  on any task — code, design, review, or analysis. Dispatches models in parallel,
  scores with a sealed panel (3 judge models, median consensus), tracks ELO
  ratings across sessions, and declares winners with dramatic esports-style flair.
  Say "run hackathon" and describe what you want built, reviewed, or improved.
