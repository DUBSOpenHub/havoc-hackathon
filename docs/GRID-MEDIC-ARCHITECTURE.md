# 🚑 Why Grid-Medic Is the Heart of Havoc Hackathon

Grid-Medic is the **closed-loop immune system** that makes the entire Havoc Hackathon ecosystem self-sustaining. Without it, agents degrade over time. With it, they continuously improve — and Havoc Hackathon itself is the engine Grid-Medic uses to heal.

## Grid-Medic's 5 Superpowers

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((🚑 Grid-Medic))
    🔍 Diagnosis Engine
      Scans all .agent.md files
      Reads scan outputs
      Detects 🔴 Errors / 🟡 Inefficiencies / 🟢 Enhancements
      SQL-backed trend analysis
    🚨 Hackathon Escalation
      Score ≤ 5/10 triggers rewrite
      3+ critical errors triggers rewrite
      up to 13 models compete to fix it
      Ensemble synthesis merges best parts
    ✅ Multi-Model Validation
      Every fix validated by 3 models
      Claude + GPT + Gemini consensus
      2/3 approval required
      Prevents bad fixes from landing
    🔄 Auto-Rollback Safety
      YAML integrity checks
      Instant git revert on failure
      Never breaks a working agent
      Preserves agent personality
    📈 Persistent Memory
      SQL tables track quality over time
      Cross-session trend analysis
      Identifies most-improved agents
      Measures fleet health average
```

## The Recursive Self-Improvement Loop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Fleet as 🤖 Agent Fleet
    participant Medic as 🚑 Grid-Medic
    participant Arena as 🏟️ Havoc Hackathon
    participant Models as 🧠 12 AI Models

    Fleet->>Medic: Agents run scans (outputs)
    Medic->>Medic: Diagnose: score each agent 1-10

    alt Score > 5/10
        Medic->>Medic: Prescribe surgical fix
        Medic->>Models: Validate fix (3-model consensus)
        Models-->>Medic: 2/3 APPROVE ✅
        Medic->>Fleet: Apply fix → agent improved
    else Score ≤ 5/10 🚨
        Medic->>Arena: ESCALATE — agent critically broken
        Arena->>Models: up to 13 models compete to rewrite it
        Models-->>Arena: Submissions judged, ensemble merged
        Arena-->>Medic: Winning rewrite delivered
        Medic->>Medic: Re-diagnose → confirm improvement
        Medic->>Fleet: Deploy upgraded agent
    end

    Note over Fleet,Models: Loop repeats every scan cycle — fleet improves forever 📈

> **Grid-Medic is the only component that both _uses_ Havoc Hackathon AND _heals_ Havoc Hackathon.**
> It's the recursive core — the agent that improves all agents, including itself.
> Without Grid-Medic, Havoc Hackathon is a one-shot tool.
> With Grid-Medic, it's a **self-improving system**.
