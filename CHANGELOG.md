# 📋 Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Monthly model-roster refresh on the first day of each month using the official GitHub Copilot supported-model documentation.
- Generated `config/models.json` catalog shared by the skill, agent, README, and dry-run validation.

### Changed
- Replaced retired models with the September 15, 2026 GitHub Copilot roster, including Claude Opus 5, Claude Sonnet 5, GPT-6 Astra, GPT-5.6, Gemini 3.8 Flash, Kimi K3, and Grok 4.6.
- Expanded tournament bracket sizing to support the full current roster with approximately four contestants per heat.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- 🏟️ **Tournament Mode (default)**  -  All available models (up to 14) compete in elimination heats instead of just 3. Elastic brackets auto-size based on model count (12→4×3, 9→3×3, 6→2×3, ≤4→classic). Serpentine ELO-based seeding spreads top models across heats.
- 🧬 **Evolution Brief**  -  After Round 1 judging, orchestrator generates a structured brief from judge scores: winning strategies, top categories, key differentiators. Prepended to Round 2 prompt so finalists can incorporate or beat Round 1's best ideas. Zero extra LLM calls.
- 🗳️ **Ensemble Synthesis**  -  Replaces cherry-pick-from-winner with voting merge across ALL finalists. CONSENSUS (3+ agree, auto-accept), MAJORITY (2 agree, note alternative), UNIQUE (highest scorer wins, flag others). Integrator agent gets explicit merge rules with provenance annotations.
- ⚖️ **Per-heat judge panels**  -  3 judges × N heats dispatched in parallel (up to 12 judge agents in Round 1). Judge model assignments rotate across heats for diverse perspectives.
- 🃏 **Wildcard entry**  -  If an entire heat is DQ'd, the highest-scoring eliminated model from another heat gets a wildcard entry to the finals.
- 🎤 **3 new commentary lines**  -  Heat advance, evolution, and ensemble quips.
- 🏗️ **Tournament bracket recap**  -  Phase 8 closing ceremony shows visual bracket (N models → heats → finalists → champion).
- 📊 **Per-round ELO**  -  ELO adjustments calculated within heats (Round 1) and finals (Round 2) separately, generating more data points per hackathon.
- 🗄️ **`round` column**  -  Added to `hackathon_judge_scores`, `hackathon_consensus`, and `hackathon_results` tables for cross-round analytics.

### Changed
- Default mode changed from 3-model direct competition to tournament elimination with all available models.
- Phase 6 merge option renamed from "Smart merge" to "Ensemble synthesis" with explicit CONSENSUS/MAJORITY/UNIQUE voting rules.
- Agent count per full tournament run: ~8 → ~28.

### Preserved
- Classic Mode via "quick" or "fast" keywords  -  identical 3-model behavior as v1.x.
- Same 9 phases (0-8), same MC energy, same ask_user prompts, same closing ceremony.
- All existing features, commentary lines, and rules preserved (new items are additive only).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- 🔧 **Results display before merge prompt**  -  Phase 5 now has explicit numbered checklist of mandatory display items (scoreboard, comparison view, strengths/weaknesses). Phase 6 adds a "Results Gate" requiring results to be displayed before calling `ask_user` for merge options. Removed "proceed immediately" language that caused models to rush past showing results.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- ⏳ **Stall detection**  -  if a contestant produces no output after 180 seconds, asks the user whether to keep waiting (60s extension) or DQ and continue. Auto-DQs on second stall.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- ⚡ **Model tier selection**  -  prompts user to choose Standard or Premium models before each hackathon
- Standard tier defaults: Claude Sonnet 4.6, Codex Max (GPT-5.1), GPT-5.2 (contestants) + Claude Sonnet 4.5, Codex (GPT-5.2), GPT-5.1 (judges)
- Premium tier opt-in via `"run hackathon with premium models"` or explicit model names
- Tier badges (⚡ STANDARD / 👑 PREMIUM) shown in opening ceremony

### Changed
- Default tier changed from Premium to Standard  -  works for all Copilot subscription levels out of the box

### Removed
- 🗑️ **Tag team mode**  -  removed from SKILL.md and agent.md

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- 🔥 **Rematch mode**  -  tiebreaker round with user-chosen 6th criterion when margin ≤ 2 points
- 📼 **Replay export**  -  save full hackathon transcript as shareable markdown highlight reel
- 📊 **Post-match analytics**  -  model performance trends, win rates by task type, ASCII charts
- 💾 **Persistent ELO**  -  leaderboard saved to `~/.copilot/hackathon-elo.json` across sessions
- 🧪 Playbooks 7-11 in TESTING.md covering all new features
- ✅ 6 new QA checklist items

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-20
