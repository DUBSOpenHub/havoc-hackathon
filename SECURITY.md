## 📋 Best Practices

Since this is a Copilot CLI skill (no runtime code, only markdown instructions), the primary security considerations are:

- 🔑 **No secrets in skill files** — SKILL.md and agent.md should never contain API keys, tokens, or credentials
- 📜 **Safe instructions** — Skill instructions should never instruct the agent to bypass security controls
- 🔍 **Dependency awareness** — If dependencies are added in the future, keep them updated
