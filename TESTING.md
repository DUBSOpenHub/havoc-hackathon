# 🧪 Testing Guide

This document describes how to verify the Havoc Hackathon skill works correctly.

Since this is a conversational AI skill (not traditional code), testing is done through **conversation playbooks**  -  scripted interactions that verify expected behavior.

---

## 🎮 How to Test Locally

1. **Register the skill** in a Copilot CLI session:
   ```
   /skills add ./
   ```

2. **Run each playbook** below and verify the expected behavior.

3. **Check the QA checklist** at the bottom before submitting a PR.

## 🔍 YAML/Markdown Validation

Verify catalog metadata:

```bash
# Check YAML syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('skills/havoc-hackathon/catalog.yml'))" && echo "✅ YAML valid"

# Check required fields
python3 -c "
import yaml
d = yaml.safe_load(open('skills/havoc-hackathon/catalog.yml'))
required = ['schema_version','id','name','description','emoji','codename','category']
missing = [f for f in required if f not in d]
print('✅ All required fields present' if not missing else f'❌ Missing: {missing}')
"
```
